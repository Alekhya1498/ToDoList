# The Todoer

> Author: Alekhya G.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The Todoer simply does cread, read, update and delete operatiosn with tasks.

## Running the App

1. Clone this github repository to your local machine.
2. The server runs in Node environment with the help of `npm`.
3. Navigate to project's directory and run `yarn install` to install the dependencies needed to run the app successfully.
4. Use `yarn start` to run the app locally on `localhost:3000`

## Notes

1. This projects contains most minimal code needed to build a simply Todo App.
2. The `create-react-app` installs `react-scripts` as CLI. The `yarn start` command invokes `react-scripts starts` that sets index.js as the entry point for the project.
3. The real requirements needed for the project submission are logically present in `App.js` file.
